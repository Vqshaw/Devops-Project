#  INTRODUCTION TO LINUX AND BASIC COMMANDS
Linux is a family of **open-source Unix** operating system based on the Linux Kernel. They include Fedora, Ubuntu, Open SUSE, red HAT, and Dabian. It is required that when using Linux operating systems, you use a shell (a shell is a program that gives you access to the operating system's services.)

Tasks that require multiple steps on the GUI (Graphical User Interface) can be done in a matter of seconds by entering commands into the CLI (Command-line Interface). That is why it is recommended to use the CLI because it is faster, quicker, and it offers more control.


##  What is a Linux Command?
A Linux command is utility or program that on the CLI. What is this CLI? it is a console that interacts with the system using texts and processes. 

By pressing Enter at the end of every line, Linux commands are executed on the terminal. You can run commands to perform various tasks, such as: file manipulation, user management to package installation. 

A typical command syntax looks like this:
>`CommandName [option(s)] [parameter(s)]`
